Security Game
├── ​General Premise
│   ​├── ​User is a rouge AI navigating through cyberspace
│   ​└── ​The game takes place as a Turtle on an HTML Canvas

├── ​Key Stages
│   ​├── ​The Map
│   ​│   ​├── ​Loading a Map
│   ​│   ​│   ​├── ​The map should be loadable from the image
│   ​│   ​│   ​└── ​When a turtle hits a black pixel (wall) it dies
│   ​│   ​└── ​Map Specifications
│   ​│   ​    ​└── ​The map is under fog-of-war
│   ​├── ​Designing POI
│   ​│   ​├── ​Placement
│   ​│   ​│   ​├── ​Player should spawn in a random location
│   ​│   ​│   ​├── ​Nodes should be placed randomly
│   ​│   ​│   ​└── ​Security Measures placed Randomly
│   ​│   ​└── ​Security Measures
│   ​│   ​    ​├── ​Area-of-denial devices that kill turtles of a certain color that come too close
│   ​│   ​    ​├── ​Some devices kill all turtles and need to be jumped over by lifting the pen temporarily
│   ​│   ​    ​├── ​Some devices can be disabled by capturing a nearby node
│   ​│   ​    ​└── ​Disabling can allow you to simplify your code saving valuable lines
│   ​├── ​User Submitted Code
│   ​│   ​├── ​Sanitization
│   ​│   ​│   ​├── ​We are providing a text box for users to type JS into that is executed
│   ​│   ​│   ​├── ​!𝗧𝗛𝗜𝗦 𝗜𝗦 𝗗𝗔𝗡𝗚𝗘𝗥𝗢𝗨𝗦!
│   ​│   ​│   ​└── ​We need to sanitize stuff
│   ​│   ​│   ​    ​├── ​One idea is using nonsense aliases to map to library functions
│   ​│   ​│   ​    ​└── ​Another idea is the *𝘉𝘳𝘦𝘯𝘥𝘢𝘯 𝘙𝘦𝘨𝘶𝘭𝘢𝘳 𝘌𝘹𝘱𝘳𝘦𝘴𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯 𝘍𝘳𝘰𝘮 𝘏𝘦𝘭𝘭 (𝘛𝘔)*
│   ​│   ​└── ​Limitations (Gameplay)
│   ​│   ​    ​├── ​The user can only execute N instructions
│   ​│   ​    ​└── ​Some POI can give more total instruction capacity
│   ​├── ​Turtles!
│   ​│   ​└── ​The trails of each previous execution become progressively more transparent with each subsequent execution
│   ​└── ​Exposure
│   ​    ​├── ​Activating security devices and capturing POIs can raise expoure
│   ​    ​└── ​The humans make take actions to make your life difficult as they realize you exist
